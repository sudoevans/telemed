# Telemedicine App Backend

## Introduction

Welcome to the backend of the Telemedicine App! 
This application is built using Django REST Framework to provide a robust and scalable API for facilitating communication between doctors and patients. Our goal is to streamline the telehealth experience by enabling users to schedule appointments, conduct virtual consultations, and manage their healthcare needs efficiently.
